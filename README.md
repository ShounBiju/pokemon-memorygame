## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-game
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the packages required for the app to run.

### 3. Run the app

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app on http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

* `npm start`
  Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

* `npm test`
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

* `npm run build`
  Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. This optimizes the React app for the best performance, minifies the code, and includes hashed filenames for cache busting. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

* `npm run eject` (**One-way operation**)
  If you need full control over the build configuration, you can eject. But this will copy all the configuration files and dependencies directly into your project.

## Game Features

* Memory Card Matching: Flip and match cards.
* Score Tracker: Monitor your progress.

## Deployment

For deploying the app, you can use platforms like Netlify or Vercel. To deploy on Netlify:

* Push your code to GitHub (if not already done).
* Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
* Netlify will automatically detect the React app and handle the deployment.

Alternatively, you can build the project using `npm run build` and upload the `build/` folder to your hosting provider.
